# WiFi-Turntable
A NoceMCU12E Based wifi turntable with an interactive site!

## Introduction
A turntable that uses a NodeMCU as a webserver that hosts an interactive site, all to control a stepper motor that rotates a platform a certain amount of steps, pauses a bit, and then triggers a Bluetooth shutter that takes a picture of the object of interest. The resultsant photos are then used for photgrammetry reasaons!

## Components Used
For this project, the used ocmponents are:
<ul>
  <li>NodeMCU Microcontroller</li>
  <li>28BYJ-48 5V Stepper Motor (+ULN2003 controller)</li>
  <li>An LED and a 220-ohm resistor (I went with a blue one since that is all I had)</li>
  <li>One of those Bluetooth shutters that are dirt cheap (used as a wireless shutter for taking pictures)</li>
  <li>A PN2222A NPN transistor (used  to trigger the BT Shutter)</li>
  <li>An old USB phone charger (used as the power supply for the whole project)</li>
  <li>A bunch of wires and solder</li>
</ul>

## How it works
The micrcontroller acts as an access point (through the use of the ESPASynchWebServer library) and hosts a site (accessable by entering the IP:<b>10.10.10.1</b> after connecting to the ESP network <b>"Turntable"</b>) that acts as the main interface for the whole project. The user can specify an even number of phots between 2 and 200. After the amount is specified (using a slider), the "Start!" button is pressed and the motor starts its movement. Depeneding on the number of photos taken, the motor travels an amount calculated in the code and then stops, which triggers the BT shutter to take a picture on a phone/device that is connected and is acting as the main camera. The process is repeated until either the user pauses (using the "Pause!" button), the user stops (by pressing "Pause!" twice or "Start!" once), or if the process is completed. The following is how the site looks like under use:
