A NoceMCU12E Based wifi turntable with an interactive site!

## Introduction
A turntable that uses a NodeMCU as a webserver that hosts an interactive site, all to control a stepper motor that rotates a platform a certain amount of steps, pauses a bit, and then triggers a Bluetooth shutter that takes a picture of the object of interest. The resultsant photos are then used for photgrammetry reasaons!

## Components Used
For this project, the used ocmponents are:
<ul>
  <li>NodeMCU Microcontroller</li>
  <li>28BYJ-48 5V Stepper Motor (+ULN2003 controller)</li>
  <li>An LED and a 220-ohm resistor (I went with a blue one since that is all I had)</li>
  <li>One of those Bluetooth shutters that are dirt cheap (used as a wireless shutter for taking pictures)</li>
  <li>A PN2222A NPN transistor (used  to trigger the BT Shutter)</li>
  <li>An old USB phone charger (used as the power supply for the whole project)</li>
  <li>A bunch of wires and solder</li>
</ul>

## How it works
The micrcontroller acts as an access point (through the use of the ESPASynchWebServer library) and hosts a site (accessable by entering the IP:<b>10.10.10.1</b> after connecting to the ESP network <b>"Turntable"</b>) that acts as the main interface for the whole project. The user can specify an even number of phots between 2 and 200. After the amount is specified (using a slider), the "Start!" button is pressed and the motor starts its movement. Depeneding on the number of photos taken, the motor travels an amount calculated in the code and then stops, which triggers the BT shutter to take a picture on a phone/device that is connected and is acting as the main camera. The process is repeated until either the user pauses (using the "Pause!" button), the user stops (by pressing "Pause!" twice or "Start!" once), or if the process is completed. The following is how the site looks like under use:

## Circuit Schematic
The circuit is rather basic, a bluetooth shutter is used here to trigger a phone acting as a camera to take pictures. A transistor is soldered on the buttons and is connected to the NodeMCU so that the button can be triggered. Once the user specifies the amount of pictures, the steps are calculated in the controller and the motor is turned accordingly. The following is a very simplified overview of what tahe circuit is like:

## Physical Design
The 3D model is based on AAScan, which is credited at the bottom. Their design uses a 5:1 gear ration so the code reflects that when it comes to the amount of steps needed for each picture to be taken.

## Full Demo
The following shows how the UI is used to initiaite the table to take 2 photos of a cube. The user slider can go up to 200 pictures but for showcase purposes I just went with 2 pictures. Ofcourse, a phone connected to the BT shutter is also needed to take a picture when the table stops rotating so that different pictures are taken.

## Future Work
I would like to work on the following set of features in the future, but so far the basic core features of a photogtammetry turntable is met with good results.
<ul>
 <li>Create a <b>Constant Turning Mode</b> that turns the turntable into a neat countertop ddecoration item!</li>
 <li>Add a form of animation to the site that shows shutter progress in a more "cool" manner, this one is rather ambigious, dont you think?</li>
</ul>
